# Energy-Loss-Time-Series-Forecasting
## Energy Loss Time Series Forecasting Models - Readme

This repository contains the implementation of advanced time series forecasting models, including ARMA, LSTM, and SARIMA, for predicting energy loss during distribution. These models have been developed to assist in optimizing energy distribution networks and improving operational efficiency.

### Dataset
1. Dataset is taken from International Energy Agency(IEA) monthly electricity statistics.
2. This Dataset contains Net Electricity Production, Electricity used for pumped storage, Distribution Losses of different countries and many more useful attributes.

### Models Implemented

1. ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average):
The ARMA model is a classic time series forecasting approach that captures the autoregressive and moving average components of the energy loss data. It considers the historical values and lagged errors to make accurate predictions.

### Working on....

2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
The LSTM model is a deep learning technique that can effectively capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. It utilizes recurrent neural networks with memory cells to learn and predict energy loss patterns, considering both short and long-term dependencies.

3. SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):
The SARIMA model is a powerful time series forecasting method that takes into account seasonal patterns in the data. It combines the autoregressive, moving average, and seasonal components to accurately predict energy loss based on historical patterns and trends.

### Requirements

The implementation is based on Python 3.7 or later. The following libraries are required:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Statsmodels
- TensorFlow (for LSTM)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (optional, for visualization)

### Usage

Make sure to have the necessary data available in the specified format or adapt the code to your specific dataset.
